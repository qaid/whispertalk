## 🚀 Quick Start

### 1. Install Dependencies

```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/qaid/lookmanohands.git
cd lookmanohands

# Build
swift build -c release
```

### 2. Download Whisper Model

**Easy Way**: Look Ma No Hands will prompt you to download a model on first launch. Choose "tiny" for best speed.

**Manual Way** (optional):
```bash
mkdir -p ~/.whisper/models
cd ~/.whisper/models

# Download tiny model (75 MB)
curl -L -O https://huggingface.co/ggerganov/whisper.cpp/resolve/main/ggml-tiny.bin

# Download Core ML acceleration (14 MB) - 5-10x faster!
curl -L -O https://huggingface.co/ggerganov/whisper.cpp/resolve/main/ggml-tiny-encoder.mlmodelc.zip
unzip ggml-tiny-encoder.mlmodelc.zip
rm ggml-tiny-encoder.mlmodelc.zip
```

You can also download and switch models from **Settings → Models** in the app.

### 3. Run

```bash
.build/release/LookMaNoHands
```

### 4. Optional: Install Ollama (for Meeting Transcription)

If you want AI-powered meeting notes:

```bash
# Install Ollama
brew install ollama

# Start Ollama service
ollama serve

# Download a model (in a new terminal)
ollama pull qwen2.5:3b
```

### 5. Grant Permissions

On first launch, grant:
1. **Microphone access**: To capture your voice for dictation
2. **Accessibility access**: To insert text and monitor Caps Lock key
3. **Screen recording** (optional): Required for system audio capture in meeting transcription

**Note**: After granting accessibility permission, you may need to restart the app. Look Ma No Hands will prompt you to restart automatically.

## ⚡ Performance

| Model | Size | Speed (16s audio) | Accuracy | Recommended |
|-------|------|-------------------|----------|-------------|
| **tiny** | 75 MB | **~1s** (Core ML) | Good for dictation | ✅ **Yes** |
| base | 142 MB | ~2-3s (Core ML) | Better accuracy | For longer transcriptions |
| small | 466 MB | ~5-7s (Core ML) | High accuracy | Complex terminology |

**With Core ML**: 8-15x faster on Apple Silicon!
**Without Core ML**: Falls back to CPU (still works, just slower)

See [PERFORMANCE.md](PERFORMANCE.md) for optimization details.

## 🛠️ Requirements

### For Voice Dictation
- **macOS 14+** (Sonoma or later)
- **Apple Silicon** recommended (Intel Macs supported but slower)
- **~200 MB disk space** for tiny model + Core ML

### For Meeting Transcription
- **macOS 14+** (Sonoma or later) - for ScreenCaptureKit
- **Ollama** installed and running locally
- **Screen recording permission** (for system audio capture)
- **Additional disk space** for Ollama model (~2-4 GB)

## 📝 How It Works

### Voice Dictation
1. **Audio Capture**: AVFoundation records high-quality 16kHz mono audio from microphone
2. **Transcription**: Whisper.cpp with Core ML converts speech to text
3. **Formatting**: Rule-based system adds capitalization and punctuation
4. **Insertion**: Accessibility API pastes text directly into focused field

All processing happens on your Mac in under 1 second!

### Meeting Transcription
1. **System Audio Capture**: ScreenCaptureKit records audio from your video call app
2. **Continuous Transcription**: Audio is chunked and transcribed in real-time using Whisper
3. **Live Display**: Transcript appears as you speak during the meeting
4. **AI Processing**: When you click "Generate Notes", Ollama transforms the raw transcript into structured meeting notes
5. **Structured Output**: Returns formatted document with decisions, action items, discussion summary, etc.

## 🔧 Configuration

### Whisper Models
Change models in **Settings → Models → Dictation**:
- **tiny** (75 MB): Fastest, recommended for dictation
- **base** (142 MB): Better accuracy
- **small** (466 MB): High accuracy for complex terminology
- **medium** (1.5 GB): Highest accuracy

Models are downloaded automatically when you select them.

### Meeting Note Customization
In the Meeting Transcription window:
1. **Add Jargon/Terms**: Enter domain-specific terms (e.g., "LLM, RAG, embeddings") to improve accuracy
2. **Customize Prompt**: Expand "Advanced: Edit Full Prompt" to modify the output format
3. **Reset to Default**: Restore the default professional meeting assistant prompt

## 🐛 Troubleshooting

### Voice Dictation Issues

**Accessibility permission granted but still not working?**
- The app needs to restart after granting accessibility permission
- Look Ma No Hands will prompt you to restart automatically - click "Restart App Now"

**Core ML not loading?**
- Check console for `whisper_init_state: Core ML model loaded`
- Ensure `.mlmodelc` file is in `~/.whisper/models/`
- Requires macOS 12+ and Apple Silicon for best performance

**Text not inserting?**
- Some apps restrict accessibility—Look Ma No Hands falls back to clipboard
- Check Accessibility permissions in System Settings

**Caps Lock not working?**
- The app monitors Caps Lock presses (doesn't change actual Caps Lock state)
- Ensure Accessibility permission is granted

### Meeting Transcription Issues

**"Ollama: Not Running" in Settings?**
- Start Ollama: `ollama serve` in terminal
- Or install if not installed: `brew install ollama`
- Check connection in Settings → Models → Meeting Transcription → Check Connection

**No system audio being captured?**
- Grant Screen Recording permission in System Settings
- Restart the app after granting permission
- Make sure audio is playing through your speakers (not muted)

**Meeting notes generation fails?**
- Ensure Ollama is running: `ollama serve`
- Verify you have a model: `ollama list`
- Download a model if needed: `ollama pull qwen2.5:3b`
- Check Ollama model name matches in Settings → Models

- English-only (Whisper supports other languages, but not tested)

### Meeting Transcription
- System audio capture requires Screen Recording permission
- ScreenCaptureKit requires macOS 14+ (Sonoma or later)
- Speaker identification not yet implemented (all text appears as one speaker)
- Ollama must be running locally for AI-powered note generation
- Meeting notes are not automatically saved (copy/paste to save)
